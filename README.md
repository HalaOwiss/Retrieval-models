# 🔍 Information Retrieval Models

This repository contains implementations of foundational **Information Retrieval (IR)** techniques. It includes both simple notebook-based experiments (e.g., TF-IDF and BM25) and a full Python-based modular retrieval system with preprocessing, indexing, and querying.

## 📘 Overview

This project helps users understand and experiment with core IR methods, including:

- **TF-IDF and cosine similarity**
- **BM25 ranking**
- **Stemming (Porter)**
- **Text preprocessing**
- **Query matching**
- **Scoring and ranking results**
